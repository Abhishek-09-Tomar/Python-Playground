# Topic to be learn in that file is : Variables, Data types, and Type casting in Python

# Variables in Python : variable is a container that stores some value.
# Data types : int, float, boolean, list, dictionary, sets, etc
# Type Casting : to change the variable from one data type to another data types(like int -> string, float -> int, and many more).

# variable that store the name of a person and it's data type is String.
name = "Abhishek"
print(name)

# variable that store the age of a person and it's data type is integer.
age = 21
print(age)

#variable that store the marks of a person and it's data type is float.
cgpa = 8.5
print(cgpa)


# print the data types of each variable that tells us the types of variable
print(type(name))
print(type(age))
print(type(cgpa))
