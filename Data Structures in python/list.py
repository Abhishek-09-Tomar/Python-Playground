Data Structures in Python :-

Data structures in Python are ways of organizing and storing data. They are essential for efficient data management and manipulation. Python has several built-in data structures, each with unique characteristics:

list, set, dictionaries and Tuples"""

# list data structure in python : list can store the multiple values of different data types.
# list is a mutable

# creating a list of marks
marks = [23,34,53,34,65]
print(marks)

# creating a mixed list : having different types of data types.
mixed = [43, "hello", False, 54.98]
print(mixed)


# accessing the list of elements.
print(marks[0])
print(mixed[2])

# slicing in list.
print(marks[0:3])

# slicing in list mixed.
print(mixed[0:3])
